### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because of how much a good introduction it was to coding and working with a partner. I was a bit new to coding so the first lab helped me understand the basics. It was also my first time working with a partner on a coding project and it was such a cool experience.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I was always curious about how vectors worked and why they were important. I was able to write functions with vectors easily thanks to the instructions and the help of my partner. It was really fun!

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because I always wondered how guessing games were programmed. I was able to figure out how to code for the guessing game with ease thanks to the helpful instructions. The lab was very interesting and I hope to do more like it in the future.
